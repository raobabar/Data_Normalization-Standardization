# Data_Normalization-Standardization
Data rescaling is an important part of data preparation before applying machine learning algorithms.

Data Normalization refers to rescaling real valued numeric attributes into the range 0 and 1. It is useful to scale the input attributes for a model that relies on the magnitude of values, such as distance measures used in k-nearest neighbors and in the preparation of coefficients in regression.

Data Standardization refers to shifting the distribution of each attribute to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (unit variance). It is useful to standardize attributes for a model that relies on the distribution of attributes such as Gaussian processes.
